# Welcome

My portfolio was built with React and features a nes.css framework and css3 for the front-end design. 
The design was inspired by early Nintendo games and calls back to an early 90's aesthetic and upon discovering the nes.css, I knew it
would be the perfect framework to bring my vision to life. 

Displayed are gifs of the functionality of my site and visitors will also be able to view my resume and my contact info.


## Technology

This is a React App with a Nes.css framework front end. Axios is used to make API calls to fetch data. React router DOM is used to dynamically load page links and to use the hash router. Github pages are used to host the app on Github.
